# restraurant-review using NLP


## Overview

An application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to restaurant reviews is being demonstrated in this project. The project analyzes and understands customer opinions and sentiments expressed in restaurant reviews. By leveraging NLP, we can extract valuable insights from these reviews, such as sentiment polarity, key topics, and more.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-review-nlp.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Gather restaurant review data. You can use web scraping tools or datasets available online.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to clean, tokenize, and prepare it for NLP analysis.

3. **NLP Analysis**: Implement various NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and keyword extraction. You can use libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or scikit-learn for these tasks.

4. **Results and Visualization**: Visualize the results using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly. Create visualizations to showcase sentiment distribution, topic modeling results, and other insights.

5. **Interpretation**: Interpret the NLP results and draw conclusions about customer sentiments and common themes in the reviews.

## Data Collection

Explain how you collected the restaurant review data. If you scraped data from websites, mention the tools or scripts used. If you used pre-existing datasets, provide the source and any necessary attribution.

## Data Preprocessing

Describe the steps taken to preprocess the data. This may include text cleaning, tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization.

## NLP Techniques

Detail the NLP techniques used in the project. Mention the libraries and algorithms applied, such as sentiment analysis with VADER, LDA topic modeling, TF-IDF vectorization, etc.

## Results and Visualization

Present the results of your analysis. Include visualizations that help convey insights from the restaurant reviews. For example, you can show sentiment distribution, word clouds of common terms, or topic modeling results.
